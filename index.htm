        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Gobinda Mishra, and I had completed Diploma in Electronics Engineering from Utkalmani Gopabandhu Institute of Engineering, Rourkela. I am passionate about designing and developing innovative electronic systems and have a strong foundation in circuit design, microcontrollers, and embedded systems.
            During my academic journey, I worked on several exciting projects, including Home Automation, Robotics, Home Safety etc which allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. I have also completed internships at [Company Name], where I gained hands-on experience in IoT, Networking, Coding etc.
            I am proficient in programming languages such as C and Python and have experience with tools like MATLAB, Multisim, and Arduino. My strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to work collaboratively make me an ideal candidate for roles in electronics design and development.
            In addition to my technical skills, I am a proactive learner who is always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies. I am excited to contribute to innovative projects and am looking forward to starting my career in the field of electronics engineering.</p>
